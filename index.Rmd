## Variables

--- .class #id 

## These things are called variables

### A variable is something that can be measured or counted

**There are three main types:**

1. Categorical variables

2. Ordinal variables

3. Quantitative variables
  - Continuous
  - Discrete

### The type of variable determines how data should be analysed and visualised

--- .class #id 

## Categorical variables

*[Can be referred to as qualitative or nominal variables]*

  >- Things that have distinct categories
  >- Qualitative (assigned or named, not quantified)
  >- A fixed (or limited) number of possibilities
  >- Categories cannot be divided or multiplied
  >- Examples: 
    + Presence/absence of anything
    + DNA nucleotides
    + species

--- .class #id 

## Ordinal variables

*[Can be referred to as ranked variables]*

  >- Things that can be ranked
  >- Categories that can be put in a sequence
  >- Qualitative (assigned or named, not quantified)
  >- A fixed (or limited) number of possibilities
  >- Categories cannot be divided or multiplied
  >- But we can identify a middle value
  >- Examples: 
    + Often used in questionnaires, e.g. dislike, indifferent, like
    + Degrees: BSc, MSc, PhD

--- .class #id 

## Quantitative variables

*[Can be referred to as numeric, interval or ratio variables]*

  >- Things that can be measured numerically
  >- Typically have **units**
  >- Values can be divided or multiplied
  >- **Continuous**
    + An infinite number of possibilities
    + Accuracy only limited by the experimental method
    + Temperature, distance, speed, time
  >- **Discrete**
    + Numerical measurements where only certain values are possible
    + Counts, e.g. number of patients, molecules, etc.

## Collecting data

--- .class #id 

## Collecting data

### A variable is something that can be measured or counted

- Taking a measurement or count is an **observation**
- The information you collect is a **value** (or datum)
- All the values together are your **data**
- The number of observations is your **sample size** (often expressed as `N`)

### Sometimes you record multiple variables from the same thing
  - *Patient number = 1234, gender = M, age = 24, heart rate = 70 bpm*
  - Here we have data for 4 variables, but it is a **single observation**

--- .class #id 

## Observations should be independent

- One observation does not affect the other
- Lack of independence can cause the sample size to be misjudged
- This is called **pseudoreplication**

>- *You measure the blood pressure of a single person 100 times*
  - 100 measurements, sample size `N` = 1 person

>- *You measure the length of 100 leaves from the same tree*
  - 100 leaves, sample size `N` = 1 tree
  
>- Note before/after measurements are fine, but these pairs represent a single observation
>- *Patient blood pressure before & after drug treatment*
  - 2 blood pressure values, sample size `N` = 1 patient

--- .class #id 

## Samples should be collected at random

- We should not bias our observations towards particular categories or values
- Often one of the most difficult aspects of study design!
- Sometimes unavoidable, requiring careful analysis and interpretation

>- *You count the number of bird species in a woodland habitat and in a lake habitat*
  - Woodland birds are harder to see

>- *You work at an diabetes clinic. You investigate how many patients smoked prior to developing diabetes*
  - You work at an diabetes clinic: all your patients develop diabetes (some of whom happen to have smoked)

--- .segue .dark 

## Organising data in a table

--- .class #id 

## Tables

### Tables are an excellent way to organise, store and analyse our data
- The format is flexible, but generally:
  + Each **row** is an observation
  + Each **column** is a variable
  + The **top row** is the variable names

>- Tables can be created and saved in `Excel`, where further analysis can be carried out
>- Bioinformaticians tend to use plain text (space, comma or tab delimited)
>- This is an ideal data format for importing into `R`

--- .class #id 

## Example tables

### Beaver body temperature

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(beaver1[1:11,1:3])
```

--- .class #id 

## Example tables

### Beaver body temperature: plain text

```{r, echo = FALSE}
beaver1[1:11,1:3]
```
